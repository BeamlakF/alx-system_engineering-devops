## Explanation:

- Users access www.foobar.com over HTTPS.
- DNS resolves www.foobar.com to the load balancer IP.
- Load balancer (HAproxy) terminates SSL using an SSL certificate.
- Traffic inside the infrastructure may be unencrypted (potential issue).
- Firewalls protect each server by restricting network traffic.
- Monitoring clients run on each server to collect metrics and logs.
- Metrics collected include CPU usage, memory, application logs, and web server QPS.
- Monitoring data is sent to a monitoring service like Sumologic for analysis.

## Components Added:

- **Firewalls:** Secure servers by filtering traffic.
- **SSL Certificate:** Enables encrypted HTTPS traffic.
- **Monitoring Clients:** Collect data to monitor server health and performance.

## Known Issues:

- SSL termination at load balancer means unencrypted internal traffic.
- Single MySQL server for writes is a scalability bottleneck.
- Running all components on the same servers may lead to resource contention and fault isolation problems.

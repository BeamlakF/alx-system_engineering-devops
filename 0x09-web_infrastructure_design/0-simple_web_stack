## Explanation:

- The user enters www.foobar.com in their browser.
- DNS resolves www.foobar.com to IP 8.8.8.8.
- The request reaches the single server at 8.8.8.8.
- Nginx web server receives the request.
- Static files served directly by Nginx.
- Dynamic requests forwarded to application server.
- Application server processes business logic and queries MySQL database.
- Database returns requested data to application server.
- Response is sent back through Nginx to userâ€™s browser.

## Infrastructure limitations:

- Single Point of Failure: If the server is down, website is unavailable.
- Downtime needed for maintenance and code deployment.
- Cannot handle high traffic; no load balancing or scaling.

# Simple Web Stack Design

This project demonstrates a simple one-server web infrastructure for hosting www.foobar.com.

## Architecture Overview

- **One Server** hosting all components:
  - Nginx as the web server
  - Application server running backend code
  - MySQL database for persistent storage
- **DNS** resolves `www.foobar.com` to the server IP `8.8.8.8`.

## Components Roles

- **Domain Name:** Maps human-friendly domain to IP address.
- **Nginx:** Handles HTTP requests and serves content.
- **Application Server:** Executes backend logic.
- **MySQL:** Manages the websiteâ€™s data storage.

## Known Issues

- Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
- Downtime during maintenance
- No horizontal scalability
